# Enhance GRPO efficiency via reasoning length control
This repository explores methods to improve the efficiency of GRPO by regulating the reasoning length of large language model outputs. By introducing length-aware reward shaping, we accelerate inference, while preserving or improving answer accuracy and format consistency.
